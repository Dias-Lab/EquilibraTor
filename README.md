# üß¨ EquilibraTor

EquilibraTor is a Python-based command-line tool that automates the setup and execution of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for protein (and optionally ligand) systems using GROMACS. The pipeline runs from topology generation to energy minimization and equilibration, with customizable execution steps.

## üöÄ Overview

<img src="figures/equilibrator_workflow.svg">
EquilibraTor streamlines MD preparation and execution in GROMACS by breaking the process into modular, automated steps. Users can run the entire pipeline or start/stop at specific steps ‚Äî ideal for debugging, re-running specific stages, or customizing workflows.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LIGAND, --ligand LIGAND
                        Path to the ligand file.
  -p PROTEIN, --protein PROTEIN
                        Path to the protein file.
  -fs FIRST_STEP, --first_step FIRST_STEP
                        Step number to start Equilibratior from (1-based)
  -ls LAST_STEP, --last_step LAST_STEP
                        Step number to end at (1-based)
  -as, --all_steps      List of Equilibrator steps and exit
```

## üìå Note

- Only the protein file is required as input. 
- When the ligand is a polypeptide or another protein, it must be combined with the main protein into a single PDB file and provided using the -p option.
- Default .mdp files (ions.mdp, minim.mdp, equilibration.mdp, equilibration_2.mdp) are in equilibrator/flat. Modify them directly to change parameters.


To show the EquilibraTor steps to be performed for a protein file:

```Text
python EquilibraTor.py -p example_protein.pdb -as

Available steps:
1: Generate topology for protein
2: Prepare to merge topology file(s) if ligand provided
3: Create the simulation box
4: Solvate the system
5: Add ions to neutralize the system
6: Run energy minimization
7: Plot potential energy
8: Obtain potential, backbone, and pressure xvgs
9: Plot panel of additional energy minimization results
10: Get final minimized pdb structure
11: Make refinement (Equilibrium)
12: Get refinement output
13: Run equilibration MD
14: Get equilibration MD output
```
To run EquilibraTor for a protein file:

```Text
python EquilibraTor.py -p example_protein.pdb
````

If you want to tweak certain parameters for your current protein file and avoid running the entire Equilibrator workflow, you can specify only the steps you wish to execute:

```Text
python EquilibraTor.py -p example_protein.pdb -fs 10 -ls 14
```

To show the EquilibraTor steps to be performed when provided both protein and ligand files:

```Text
python EquilibraTor.py -l example_ligand.pdb -p example_protein.pdb -as

Available steps:
1: Generate topology for protein
2: Convert ligand PDB to MOL2
3: Generate topology for ligand
4: Prepare to merge topology file(s) if ligand provided
5: Make a copy of protein if ligand provided
6: Merge topologies
7: Create the simulation box
8: Solvate the system
9: Add ions to neutralize the system
10: Run energy minimization
11: Plot potential energy
12: Obtain potential, backbone, and pressure xvgs
13: Plot panel of additional energy minimization results
14: Get final minimized pdb structure
15: Make refinement (Equilibrium)
16: Get refinement output
17: Run equilibration MD
18: get equilibration MD output
```

To run EquilibraTor using this protein-ligand files:

```Text
python EquilibraTor.py -l example_ligand.pdb -p example_protein.pdb
```

# üß¨ EquilibraTor

EquilibraTor is a Python-based command-line tool that automates the setup and execution of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for protein (and optionally ligand) systems using GROMACS. The pipeline runs from topology generation to energy minimization and equilibration, with customizable execution steps.

## üìå Note

- Only the protein file is required as input. 
- Multiple ligands can be provided, each into a separate PDB file
- When the ligand is a polypeptide or another protein, it must be combined with the main protein into a single PDB file and provided using the -p option.
- Default .mdp files (ions.mdp, minimization_stage.mdp, nvt_stage.mdp, npt_stage.mdp, production_stage.mdp) are in equilibrator/flat. Modify them directly to change parameters.

## Convergence analysis
EquilibraTor features an automated module for determining when a MD simulation reaches equilibrium. This analysis uses block-based statistical methods to detect stability in key observables, ensuring that only equilibrated segments are used for representative structure clustering and post-simulation analysis.

## Method Overview
EquilibraTor divides the trajectory into consecutive time blocks and computes the drift (slope) of several observables, such as RMSD, potential energy, pressure, and radius of gyration. The program checks whether these observables have stabilized by comparing their computed drift against user-defined relative thresholds.

Users define the acceptance thresholds via the `-oth` argument, for example:

-oth rmsd=0.1 potential=0.2 pressure=0.2

Each threshold specifies the maximum allowed drift as a fraction of the standard deviation of the last portion of the trajectory. When the measured drift of an observable falls below its threshold, the observable is considered stable, marking the onset of equilibration.

If multiple observables are specified, EquilibraTor can assess them either individually or jointly, depending on whether the `-rao` flag (`--req_all_obs`) is used.

## Output and Report Interpretation

Following analysis, EquilibraTor automatically generates an **Equilibration Analysis Report**, which summarizes the equilibration point for each observable and identifies the equilibrated region of the trajectory.  

Example report:

```
EQUILIBRATION ANALYSIS REPORT
============================================================

Analysis mode: Single observable (rmsd)
Block size: 10 ps
Block overlap: 0 ps
Total simulation time: 500.0 ps

EQUILIBRATION TIMES BY OBSERVABLE:
------------------------------------------------------------
  rmsd                                         50.0 ps (threshold=0.1)

------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL EQUILIBRATION START: 50.0 ps
EQUILIBRATED SEGMENT: 50.0 - 500.0 ps
EQUILIBRATED LENGTH: 450.0 ps
------------------------------------------------------------

```

In this example, RMSD reaches its stability threshold (0.1) at 50 ps, marking the start of equilibration. The equilibrated segment spans from 50 ps to the full 500 ps trajectory, corresponding to a total equilibrated duration of 450 ps. Only this portion is used for structural clustering, and from the largest cluster (cluster1), the time in(ps) for the middle representative is used to run the production stage.
